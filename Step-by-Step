Key Objectives:
    1. Music Bot can play audio
    2. Music Bot tracks music played and saves it to a text file

Roadmap - Playing Audio
    1. Register a slash command for play ✔️

    2. Get Music Bot to join voice channel
        - check if user is in a VC
            - if not, reply to user with "you must be in VC"
            - if so, move on to next step

        - check if self(bot) is in a vc
            - if not, connect to VC
            - if so, move on to next step

    3. Get Music Bot to play audio
        - Check link to see where it belongs to (YouTube, Soundcloud, Spotify, etc.)
            OR
        - Only check link to see if it's valid (try catch)
            - this allows for basically any type of link to play audio (like vimeo or maybe even twitter videos)
            - This isn't necessary for the scope of this project, but could be something to add later on
        
        - For YouTube, if the link has 'shorts' instead of 'watch'...
            - 1. Replace 'shorts' with 'watch'
            - 2. Do nothing, if audio is supported
        
        - Spotify Issues:
            - I doubt that playing a url to a spotify song would work
                - If you have spotify free, you can't play any song you like (as far as I know)
                - So, we'd need to find a work around somehow (by we I mean me, but 'we' sounds cooler)
                
        - Audio will be played via a link
        - Supported Audio include YouTube and Soundcloud - Spotify would be the next step
        
        4. Get Bot to leave the VC under certain conditions
            - Check if audio is playing
                - If so, do nothing
                - If not, then wait a certain amount of time (i.e 5 minutes)
                    - When testing, we should make this value much shorter (5 seconds)
                - If a certain amount of time elapses with no audio played, disconnect

    

Current Issues:
    - Music Bot connects to VC, but it is inconsistent
        - Errors are also inconsistent
            - Either the voice channel ID is not found...
            - ...Or the bot connects, even when the user has already left

    - I think the issue is that the state of the user is never updated
        (i.e, whatever the user's state was the last time they ran /play never changes)
