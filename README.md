# Discord-Music-List-Bot

(October 10th, 2022)
Haha just kidding! Now I'm making a full on music bot! While I'm destroying any chance of ever working at YouTube, I will at least be able to play 'Chi Chi Chimo Chimo' in the discord server. Fair trade off and I think I'm getting the better end of the deal.

"Why haven't you updated in over a month?" - All zero members of the audience ask.

Well - I'm lazy. Also school. And the gym. And...I'm lazy.
But I'm back (sound of non-existant clapping and cheering) and will work on this for at least 4 days before another month-long hiatus!

The goal of this project is to create a bot that keeps track of all the music played within my friend's discord server.
This is my first _personal_ project and repository - it serves as the starting point and a place to look back on many months from now.
